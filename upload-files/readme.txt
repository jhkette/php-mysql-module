++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Description
-----------
This zip file contains the files necessary to complete Hands on exercise "Uploading FIles" which
deals with uploading files to the server with PHP


Installation
------------
After uploading the files to the server, the permissions on the uploads
directory, as defined in includes/config.inc.php should be set to 777. 
You can do this in Filezilla (right-click > File permissions...)
 
Note, if you delete the uploads directory on the server, and then reupload it/recreate it, 
you will need to set the permissions again.


Configuration
-------------
All configuration settings can be found in:
includes/config.inc.php
(This is where the upload directory is defined)


Notes
-----
The PHP code in this package is excessively commented for instructional purposes only.
Your comments should be a lot more concise and less technical!
