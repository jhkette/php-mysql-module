Description
-----------
This package contains the files necessary to complete the session 4 hands on exercises.
The code is a amalgamation of the solutions to the previous exercises, so you may use your own code if you prefer. 
 
Installation
------------
Before deploying this application, you should ensure that you have the book, 
author and book_author tables that we created in HOE01 installed in your 
database and popultated with data. 
If you need to create them again, you should login to your database and execute 
the queries found in: install/bookstore.sql
NB: the "install" directory should not be deployed with the application.

Configuration
-------------
All configuration settings for this application can be found in: includes/config.inc.php
You should edit this file and change the values to match your database credentials
before you attempt to do anything else!

Notes
-----
The PHP code in this package is unadventurous and excessively commented for 
instructional purposes only.
In a real world application (or an assignment) the code would be more adventurous 
and the comments would be a lot more concise!
